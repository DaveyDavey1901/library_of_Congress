Refer to the following pages for bootstrap choices I tried to match the example img as close as possible:-

[Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/) Margin spacing and padding 

[Dropbox](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/) Dropdown menus i used here.

[Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/) Button options i used here.

[search input](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/input-group/) Input group i used here (default)



[format options](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#searching) All the format options and possible values.

**Search-Results html**

For the search results pages i removed all the margins and padding as well as reduced the columns by half. this shunted the search form to the top left corner as in the example img.
