# library Of Congress Mini Project


Refer to the following pages for bootstrap choices I tried to match the example img as close as possible:-

[Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/) Margin spacing and padding 

[Dropbox](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/dropdowns/) Dropdown menus i used here.

[Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/buttons/) Button options i used here.

[search input](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/input-group/) Input group i used here (default)



[format options](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#searching) All the format options and possible values.

**Search-Results html**

For the search results pages i removed all the margins and padding as well as reduced the columns by half to 3 columns. This shunted the search form to the top left corner as in the example img. I also added a button to return you to the main page and created an on click function to make it work.

Added some new divs to the right of the search form using the other 9 columns.  

A row for the header as well as the search value.  And an area below that where the results will be inserted via javascript...  at the moment i put a paragragh in there with lorem to see if the area was set up right with the background colors and spacing.
